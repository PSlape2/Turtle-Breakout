# Turtle-Breakout

This project was created for AP Computer Science Principles. We were required to create a game or visual representation using
the python turtle module. Due to the limitations of the turtle module, the program does not run very smoothly, with a few bugs.
The project took approximately 3-5 hours to complete.
